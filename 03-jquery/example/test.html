        Yale's searchable and mappable digital archive of Depression-era 
        photographs contains over 170,000 images (physically housed by 
        the Library of Congress), taken throughout the United States.

        The effort is totally unique in size and scale for a federal 
        government-sponsored photography project and you should definitely 
        take some time to browse through the fascinating results.

        These kids were literally always playing in undesirable places

        One of the first things I searched for was "children playing." 
        Refining the search by the classification "in street and undesirable 
        places" narrowed the results negligibly because, as it turns out, 
        kids in the late 1930s and early 1940s were literally always 
        playing in undesirable places.
