# Example solutions

We take into account the completness of the exercise and quality of the solution.

*Solution 1*
This exercise is functional but the solution is not optimal. 
It is much more efficient and scalable to have one single event listener for the cards, instead of an individual one for each.

*Solution 2*
This solution is functional, the implementation well documented and elegant. 

*Solution 3*
The solution is partially functional, but the implementation is clear and well structured. 
With almost no effort can be fixed.
